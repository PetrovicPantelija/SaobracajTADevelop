Syncfusion [Spreadsheet](https://www.syncfusion.com/winforms-ui-controls/spreadsheet?utm_source=nuget&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=windows-spreadsheet-nuget) for Windows Forms is a .NET library that allows the user to create, edit, view, and format Microsoft Excel files without Excel installed. It provides an ease-of-use UI experience with an integrated ribbon to cover any possible business scenarios.

## Key features:

* Formulas: Provides support for 400+ of the most widely used formulas and allows the user to add, remove, and edit the formulas in an Excel-like manner.

* Floating and merge Cells: Provides support for floating cells when and merge cells as in Excel. 
* Conditional Formatting: Provides support for Excel-compatible conditional formatting, and allows you to apply formats to a cell or range of cells depending on the value of the cells or formula that meet specific criteria.
* Data validation: Provides support to ensure data integrity by forcing end users to enter valid data into cells. If entered data does not meet the specified criteria, an error message is displayed.

* Grouping: Provides support to group or ungroup rows and columns.

* Localization: Provides support to localize all static text in a ribbon and all dialogs to any desired language.

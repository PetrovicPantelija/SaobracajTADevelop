Chart is a high-performance charting component that is easy to use and visually stunning. It includes 35 chart types, ranging from simple column charts to specialized financial charts. The charts are highly customizable and have a powerful data model to make data binding simple.

### Key features

* Chart Data Model is an innovative data object model which makes it easy to populate the chart with any kind of data source.
* Essential Chart features built in support for dates. The data type of any series that is plotted on the chart can be set to DateTime.
* Essential Chart offers automatic interval calculation capabilities for any range of numbers or dates. This calculation can be overridden by explicit allocation of ranges and intervals to be used and also with settings that control how ‘nice’ numbers are calculated for display.
* Essential Chart offers extensive customization possibilities of the legend. The position of the legend on the chart area as well as its representation aspects can all be completely customized. Essential Chart also features modification of legend items using events. It also supports custom legend items that are not tied to series of data.
* Statistical formula means, Standard Deviation, Variance, Distributions, T-test, F-test and Z-test support etc.

Chart Breaks are very useful when you use series points with large difference.

## Sparkline

A Sparkline control is a type of information graphic characterized by its small size, high data density and lightweight. It presents trends and variations in a very condensed fashion. The Sparkline does not contain an axis scale and is intended to give a high level overview of what happened to the data over time.
